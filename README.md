# Building Cosmo with EB and the build script

This is a temporary tutorial to allow people to build their own version of crCLIM COSMO-pompa (CrCLIM or Cordex setup).
The steps are only describing on how to compile the model **on DAINT with the CRAY compiler** .

The idea is that now each one will: 
  * compile its own version of Stella and the Dycore, 
  * install it as a module 
  * load it when one need to compile Cosmo.
Then to compile Cosmo one can use the classic build script and provide its personal version of the Dycore to the build script.

We provide a TL;DR for the impatient.
But it's recommended that you read the full documentation.
As compiling the model is very slow on Daint (it takes on average 60 minutes!), you may trigger the compilation with the instruction in the TL;DR section and read the full documentation while it's compiling. 
If the TL;DR doesn't work, read the full documentation.

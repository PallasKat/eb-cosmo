# Building Cosmo with EB and the build script

This is temporary tutorial to allow people to build their own version of crCLIM COSMO-pompa.
The steps are only describing on how to compile the model on **DAINT** with the **CRAY** compiler.

We provide a TL;DR for the impatient.
But it's recommended that you read the full documentation.
As compiling the model is very slow on Daint, you may trigger the compilation with the TL;DR section and read the full documentation while it's compiling. 
If the TL;DR doesn't work, read the full documentation.

# TL;DR

For this TL;DR we assume that we're working from the hypotetic "scratch" directory of the user `username`:
```
/scratch/username/
``` 
but the following instructions apply for any wokring directory.
We also assume that everything is executed in the **same** terminal.

## Building Stella and the Dycore

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:PallasKat/eb-cosmo.git
```
and go in it's directory:
```
cd eb-cosmo
```

Use the new dirver script to build the libraries needed to build Cosmo:
```
$ ./build_crclim_libs.sh -h
Usage: build_crclim_libs.sh -p project -t target -i path [-z]
```
where `-p` is the project (or setup): `crclim` or `cordex`, the `-t` is the target: `cpu` or `gpu`, and `-i` the module install path.
For example installing Stella and the Dycore with the Cordex setup for CPU in `/scratch/username/install/`:
```
$ ./build_crclim_libs.sh -p cordex -t cpu -i /scratch/username/install/
```
and note that the install directory must exist **before** executing the script.
At the end the script output variables to export and module to load:
```
export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=/scratch/username/install/
export EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH=/tmp/username/easybuild
module load daint-gpu
module load EasyBuild-custom
```
and execute them in your current environment (i.e. terminal).

## Building Cosmo-pompa

Change to the directory containing the Cosmo source you want to compile.
For example, we assume that the Cosmo we want to compile is here:
```
cd /scratch/username/cosmo-pompa/cosmo
```
and we start by executing the Cosmo builds script to trigger the environement fetching:
```
test/jenkins/build.sh -h
```
and replace the Daint environment by the one provided by this repository:
```
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/env.daint.sh test/jenkins/env/
```
and the `option.lib` files for both architectures:
```
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/Options.lib.cpu .
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/Options.lib.gpu .
```
As we previously installed the Cordex DyCore for CPU, we load the corresponding module:  
```
module load DYCORE_CRCLIM_CPU/cordex-CrayGNU-18.08-double
```
and we run the Cosmo build script:
```
test/jenkins/./build.sh -z -c cray -t gpu -x $EBVERSIONDYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU
```
et voilÃ ! After a waiting time close to ~1h to 1h30' you have a working Cosmo executable.

# Extended version of the tutorial

This extended version assume that you've tried the TL;DR once.
This extended version provide details to better understand the structure of this new way of building the libraries needed for the Cosmo model.

It's important to notice that this current approach is diverging from the one used by MeteoSwiss and thus cannot be yet applied ok Kesch.
This also mean that currently we cannot (and we won't) merge it into the `crclim` branch of Cosmo-pompa.

## About the repository

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:PallasKat/eb-cosmo.git
```
and go in it's directory:
```
cd eb-cosmo
```
where you can see that there are several easybuild (EB) config files.
Two are for STELLA:
```
STELLA_CORDEX-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
STELLA_CRCLIM-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
```
and four for the C++ Dycore:
```
DYCORE_CORDEX_CPU-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
DYCORE_CORDEX_GPU-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
DYCORE_CRCLIM_CPU-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU-CrayGNU-18.08-double.eb
```
and respectively contain the information to build Stella and the Dycore with EB.
As you can deduce from the filenames, some are for the crCLIM or Cordex setup, and to target the CPU or GPU.

The difference compared to the classic build scripts is that EB is going to make Stella and the Dycore available as modules on Daint. So once it's install you'll have to load the needed Dycore depending on the configuration you need.

You don't have to invoke EB yourself, you should only use the provided script `build_crclim_libs.sh`. 
This script drives the call to EB to build the Stella and Dycore libraries and make them available as modules.
The goal is to minimise the steps the domain scientist need to do and ensure coherence between the build.

You can also see that there is a directory `env`.
It contains environment specific to the post-update Daint.
However as there is currently no agreement between MeteoSwiss and the CSCS on an unified way of building the model, the `buildenv` is not going to be updated.
So these files are going to be manually copied before building Cosmo.

## Building Stella and the Dycore

Building and installing Stella and the Dycore is done through the driving script `build_crclim_libs.sh`. 
To invoke the script you should provide at least the project (i.e. crclim or cordex), the targeted architecture (i.e. cpu or gpu) and an install path.
It's important to note that the install path must exist before executing the script.

There is a command line help that decribes what you can pass to the script:
```
$ ./build_crclim_libs.sh -h
Usage: build_crclim_libs.sh -p project -t target [-z]

Arguments:
-h           show this help message and exit
-p project   build project: crclim or cordex
-t target    build target: cpu or gpu
-i path      install path for the modules (EB prefix, the directory must exist)
-z           clean any existing repository, reclone it, and create new source archive
```

The script fetch (clone) the `crclim` branch of the `stella` and the `cosmo-pompa` repositories from the `C2SM-RCM` organisation.
This is the default behavior and it's hardcoed in the script. 
To change it, you need to modify the script (see "Advanced usage of the script").

Once the sources are fetched, it creates an archive of the sources (a `tar.gz` file).
One for Stella: `stella.tar.gz` and one for the Dycore: `dycore.tar.gz`.
This is because we don't have release yet and EB is expecting an archive from a release or a files list.
The easiest way to hack it was to create the "release" (i.e. the archive) on the fly from the cloned repositories. 

The script invokes EB to build `grib_api` and `libgrib_api`, through CSCS EB config files, as long with Stella and the C++ Dycore:
```
$ ./build_crclim_libs.sh -t gpu -p cordex -i 
```
in this example with `-p cordex` we ensure that Stella is built with `KFLAT=8` and `KLEVEL=40` and that the Dycore will be build for GPU and use the corresponding version of Stella. 
The correct version is selected according the values provided with the flags:
```
-p crclim -t cpu -> Stella with KSIZE=60 and KFLAT=19 and a CPU Dycore
-p crclim -t gpu -> Stella with KSIZE=60 and KFLAT=19 and a GPU Dycore 
-p cordex -t cpu -> Stella with KSIZE=40 and KFLAT=8  and a CPU Dycore
-p cordex -t gpu -> Stella with KSIZE=40 and KFLAT=8  and a GPU Dycore 
```
No other version are currently available.

When started the script is print the requested configuration.
For example:
```
$ ./build_crclim_libs.sh -t gpu -p crclim

Compiling STELLA and the C++ DyCore as modules
===========================================================
Date             : sam oct 20 23:05:46 CEST 2018

   Cordex        : OFF
Cleanup          : OFF
Install path     : /scratch/username/install/
===========================================================
```

At end of the compilation, the script is writing what you should export and what to load:
```
# EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR TERMINAL #
# BEFORE INSTALLING COSMO                         #

export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=/scratch/username/install/
export EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH=/tmp/username/easybuild
module load daint-gpu
module load EasyBuild-custom
```
copy and past them in your terminal before trying to load the Stella and Dycore modules.
Now both libraries (Stella and the DyCore) will be available through modules loading.

## Building COSMO

Once the needed modules are loaded, you can see that the installed libraries are available:
```
------------ /path/to/install//modules/all ------------
DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double 
Serialbox/2.4.1-CrayGNU-18.08                 
libgrib1_crclim/a1e4271-CrayCCE-18.08 
STELLA_CRCLIM/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double     
grib_api/1.13.1-CrayCCE-18.08
```
where here we have access to a Dycore with the crCLIM setup compiled for GPU (`DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU`).
To use it, you load it as any other module:
```
module load DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double
```
which export a variable (among others) `EBROOTDYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU`:
```
$ echo $EBROOTDYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU
/scratch/username/install/software/DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double
```
and point to the installed Dycore.
The variable name will change according the setup you decided to build.
You have:
```
EBROOTDYCORE_CRCLIM_CPU -> Dycore with crCLIM setup (KSIZE=60 and KFLAT=19) for CPU
EBROOTDYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU -> Dycore with crCLIM setup (KSIZE=60 and KFLAT=19) for GPU
EBROOTDYCORE_CORDEX_CPU -> Dycore with crCLIM setup (KSIZE=40 and KFLAT=9)  for CPU
EBROOTDYCORE_CORDEX_GPU -> Dycore with crCLIM setup (KSIZE=40 and KFLAT=9)  for GPU
```

If you're unsure of the variable name, you can request details of the module with:
```
$ module show DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/path/to/install//modules/all/DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double:

```
where you see the available environement variables the module will set.
In our case we're only interested by the one pointing to the installed Dycore.

Once this is done, we can almost build Cosmo the "classical" way, that is to say with build script.

Change to the directory containing the Cosmo source you want to compile.
For example, we assume that the Cosmo we want to compile is here:
```
cd /scratch/username/cosmo-pompa/cosmo
```
and we start by executing the Cosmo builds script to trigger the environement fetching:
```
test/jenkins/build.sh -h
```
and replace the Daint environment by the one provided by this repository:
```
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/env.daint.sh test/jenkins/env/
```
and the `option.lib` files for both architectures:
```
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/Options.lib.cpu .
cp /scratch/username/eb-cosmo/env/Options.lib.gpu .
```

you can almost start to build Cosmo, you just need to replace the `env.daint.sh` as the one in the buildenv is not adapted anymore to build the model on Daint.
Start by triggering environment fetching by calling:
```
cd cosmo-pompa/cosmo
test/jenkins/./build.sh
```
then replace the Daint environment:
```
cp env.daint.sh test/jenkins/env/
```
and execute the build script as usual:
```
test/jenkins/./build.sh -c cray -t gpu -x $EBROOTDYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU
```
and you're done! After a waiting time close to ~1h to 1h30' you have a working Cosmo executable.

## Troubleshooting

1. You may encouter similar messages during the compilation with EB:
```
WARNING: Found one or more non-allowed loaded (EasyBuild-generated) modules in current environment:
* cURL/.7.47.0
* expat/.2.1.0
* zlib/.1.2.8
* libxml2/.2.9.3
* ncurses/.6.0
* gettext/.0.19.7
* Perl/5.22.1-bare
* git/.2.13.1

This is not recommended since it may affect the installation procedure(s) performed by EasyBuild.
```
but these ones can be ingnored.

2. You may enter in a "module hell" before executing the driving script:
Like:
```
EasyBuild-custom/cscs(81):ERROR:102: Tcl command execution failed: if { [ string match *daint* $system ] || [ string match *dom* $system ] } {
    setenv EASYBUILD_OPTARCH                    $::env(CRAY_CPU_TARGET)
    setenv EASYBUILD_RECURSIVE_MODULE_UNLOAD    0
} elseif { [ string match *esch* $system ] } {
    setenv EASYBUILD_MODULE_NAMING_SCHEME       LowercaseModuleNamingScheme   
} else {
    setenv EASYBUILD_RECURSIVE_MODULE_UNLOAD    1
}
```
or while executing the Cosmo build script:
```
daint-gpu(30):ERROR:105: Unable to locate a modulefile for 'craype-haswell'
```
in both case logout from the machine and login again to have a fresh environment.
If the problem occured while invoking the Cosmo build script, do not forget to export and load the corresponding modules.
First the environement:
```
export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=/scratch/username/install/
export EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH=/tmp/username/easybuild
module load daint-gpu
module load EasyBuild-custom
```
and then the needed Dycore.
For example:
```
module load DYCORE_CRCLIM_GPU/crclim-CrayGNU-18.08-double
```
and try to execute the Cosmo build script.

## Advanced usage of the script
The `-z` flag is used to clean up the repository.
As you may need to refresh it (or reclone it) the cleanup flag ensure the repository is DELETED before cloning it.
Otherwise you end up with an error of the kind:
```
fatal: destination path 'cosmo-pompa' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```
and nothing is cloned.
